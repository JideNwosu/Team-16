# Lab 1: Microcontroller

[Lab1 Handout](https://cei-lab.github.io/ece3400/lab1.html)

This lab was an introductory lab aimed to help us gain familiarity with the Arduino Uno and the Arduino IDE. Using these alongside other external components allowed us to ultimately create an autonomous robot that moved in a four sided path. Each part to this lab is outlined below, as well as the intermediate steps we took.

### Part 5: Map the value of the potentiometer to the servo 
###### (Firehiwot)
The rotation of the servos can be contorlled by changing the angle values.
   * First angle values were changed by entering numbers from 0 to 180 from the key board. (90 -stop, 0 - full speed reverse, 180 - full speed ahead):

   * Then we used the potentiometer to provide a signal which controls the rotation speed and direction.
   * A map function was used to map resistance readings from potentiometer (0 to 1023) to between 0 to 180 range.
