# Lab 1: Microcontroller

[Lab1 Handout](https://cei-lab.github.io/ece3400/lab1.html)

This lab was an introductory lab aimed to help us gain familiarity with the Arduino Uno and the Arduino IDE. Using these alongside other external components allowed us to ultimately create an autonomous robot that moved in a four sided path. Each part to this lab is outlined below, as well as the intermediate steps we took.

### Part 5: Map the value of the potentiometer to the servo 
###### (Firehiwot)
The rotation of the servos can be contorlled by changing the angle values.
   * We first controlled the movement by manually entering different values for the angles from the key board. (90 to stop, 0 and 180 rotate in opposite direction as shown in the figure below):

   * The potentiometer provides a signal which controls the rotation speed and direction.
