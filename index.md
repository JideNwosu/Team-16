Team Procedures

It is important to keep all members of the team aware of the time and date of all meetings. 
It is a good idea to pick a day, time, and place for regular team meetings. We will meet every 
week Tuesday at 5 PM. We will try to reserve a room in the Uris Library or work at the ECE lounge.

Who will set each agenda? We will rotate to set the agenda every week. 
How long before the meeting should this be announced? On Friday night, after lab. 
How will team members be notified/reminded? Personal email.
Who will be responsible for the team following the agenda during a team meeting? The team leader at the time. 
What will be done to keep the team on track during a meeting? The person who sets the agenda will keep everyone on track. 

Agree on how your team will make decisions. By consensus, majority vote, leader has veto rights, etc.? Discussion and consensus.

Always keep a written record of what was agreed upon in the meeting. Who will be responsible for taking these notes? How will they be disseminated? Where will all agendas and meeting minutes be kept? We plan to ake turns for taking notes. The person who will be a leader in the next round will be a scribe. The meeting minutes, and lab files  will be kept on our google drive. We will select and upload important files and documents on the website.

All members should agree to a preferred method of communication (e.g., e-mail, cell phone, face-to-face), and be individually responsible for answering in good time as agreed upon in the team. Please note what method(s) and response delay you agree on. We will communicate using Groupme, email and 3-4 hours is good responding time during the day when we have classes. 2-3 for other times. 

Team Expectations

Work Quality
Agree on a (realistic) level of quality for website updates, individual work/design, peer reviews, etc. One person is taking responsibility for the general layout, but specific individuals will write up separate parts corresponding to their assignments. We will discuss the website update times; however, we should do frequent modifications on the website. 

Agree on when individuals/sub-teams must finish their part (on the deadline, or hours or a day before the deadline such that other team members can check their work):  Report on progress but nothing will be submitted on the deadline exactly. Try to finish at least one-two days before the deadline so that team members can check over the work.  

Strategies to fulfill these standards:
Team Participation:
Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks: Discussions will occur every week and emails will be sent out every week to state the roles of each person that week.

Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members (team maintenance): If anyone has an idea write on the groupme.

Strategies for keeping on task (task maintenance): shared online calender outlining tasks (which will be updated every week after team meetings) and a google drive. This is the link for our team calendar: https://teamup.com/kshx1ageh1yif5gske

Strategies to get help if you’re stuck: Office hours, polls in groupme, ask for help.

Personal Accountability:
Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings: We will try to schedule times that work for everyone, but if he/she tells the rest of the team in advance, it should be okay. This should be done as early as possible. For puncutuality 0-5 minutes late is okay. 5-9 minutes is a little bad. But over 10 minutes is not acceptable. We can decide the punishment then and there (case by case).

Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines: Each of us will try to stick to our goals, if one experiences problems, let the rest of the team know so that they can accommodate. 

Expected level of communication with other team members: A few times a week (2-3) at the very least.

Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks: High commitment from everyone. 

How should a team member catch up if they have to miss a meeting: Meeting minutes and using our communication methods.

Consequences for Failing to Follow Procedures and Fulfill Expectations
Describe how, as a group, you would handle individuals who do not live up to this contract: Punishment will occur and the type will be decided at that time depending on the causes and effects.

Describe what your team will do if these infractions continue: Worse punishments. (No physical or verbal abuse or cruelty)

Team Leadership
Every person on the team will have to take the role as a leader for at least two weeks. The role of the leader will be to organize meetings and make sure that everything is submitted in a timely manner. Here are some hints on what the leader
