Preparation for Team work
You will be assigned a team of 5-7 students who you will work with throughout the semester. Every 2-3 weeks you will take turns being the group leader. Teamwork has a lot of benefits; you get a lot of different insights to solve a problem, you can work efficiently on many tasks at once, and you always have someone to check your work. It is important to be aware that in a team environment, individuals are usually effectively motivated to maximize their own rewards and minimize their own costs. Therefore, successful team performance depends on individual accountability. Writing up a team contract, and doing team assessments throughout the semester can help keep everyone on track. This is good preparation for what will happen when you move on to industry or academia, you will end up as part of a team almost anywhere you go.
According to concepts from Organizational Behavior, there are five stages of team development: forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. During the forming stage, teams tend to communicate in indirect polite ways rather than more directly. The storming stage, characterized by conflict, can be often be productive, but may consume excessive amounts of time and energy. In this stage it is important to listen well for differing expectations. Next, during the norming stage, teams formulate roles and standards, increasing trust and communication. This norming stage is characterized by agreement on procedures, reduction in role ambiguity, and increased “we-ness” or unity. These developments generally are precursors to the performing stage, during which teams achieve their goals, are highly task oriented, and focus on performance and production. The point of the team contract is to help you move to the performing stage faster.
If you find that your team is dysfunctional in any way you should address this immediately by calling a team meeting. If problems persist, seek help from TAs or the instructor.
Team Contract Assignment
Your team contract template is divided into three major sections:
establishing team procedures
identifying expectations
specifying the consequences for failing to follow these procedures and fulfill these expectations
Use the Team Contract template to discuss and finalize your team roles, procedures, and standards. Complete, sign, and upload a copy of your finalized contract to your team website by Monday, August 28th 8am.
TEMPLATE FOR TEAM CONTRACT
(Please add your input to each of the bullet points below.)
ECE 3400, Semester # _ _ _ Team # 16
Team Members: _ _ _
Team Procedures
It is important to keep all members of the team aware of the time and date of all meetings. It is a good idea to pick a day, time, and place for regular team meetings. We will meet every week Tuesday at 5 PM. We will try to reserve a room in the Uris Library or work at the ECE lounge.
Who will set each agenda? We will rotate to set the agenda every week. How long before the meeting should this be announced? On Friday night, after lab. How will team members be notified/reminded? Personal email.  Who will be responsible for the team following the agenda during a team meeting? The team leader at the time. What will be done to keep the team on track during a meeting? The person who sets the agenda will keep everyone on track 
Agree on how your team will make decisions. By consensus, majority vote, leader has veto rights, etc.? Discussion and consensus. 
Always keep a written record of what was agreed upon in the meeting. Who will be responsible for taking these notes? How will they be disseminated? Where will all agendas and meeting minutes be kept? Take turns taking notes, we will designate a scribe who will vary in each time interval. They will be kept on our google drive. (There will be links to them on the website)
All members should agree to a preferred method of communication (e.g., e-mail, cell phone, face-to-face), and be individually responsible for answering in good time as agreed upon in the team. Please note what method(s) and response delay you agree on. Groupme, email. 3-4 hours is good responding time during the day when we have classes. 2-3 for other times. 
Team Expectations
Work Quality
Agree on a (realistic) level of quality for website updates, individual work/design, peer reviews, etc. One person is taking responsibility for the general layout, but specific individuals will write up separate parts corresponding to their assignments. We will discuss the website update times, however we should do frequent modifications on the website. 
Agree on when individuals/sub-teams must finish their part (on the deadline, or hours or a day before the deadline such that other team members can check their work):  Report on progress but nothing will be submitted on the deadline exactly. Try to finish at least one-two days before the deadline so that team members can check over the work.  
Strategies to fulfill these standards:
Team Participation:
Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks: Discussions will occur every week and emails will be sent out every week to state the roles of each person that week.
Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members (team maintenance): If anyone has an idea write on the groupme.
Strategies for keeping on task (task maintenance):  https://teamup.com/kshx1ageh1yif5gske
Strategies to get help if you’re stuck: Office hours, polls in groupme, ask for help.
Personal Accountability:
Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings: We will try to schedule times that work for everyone, but if you tell the rest of the team in advance, it should be okay. As early as you can, let the team know. 0-5 minutes late is okay. 5-9 minutes is a little bad. But over 10 minutes is not acceptable. We can decide the punishment then and there.
Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines: Stick to your goals, if you experience problems, let the rest of the team know so that they can accommodate. 
Expected level of communication with other team members: A few times a week (2-3) at the very least.
Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks: High commitment. 
How should a team member catch up if they have to miss a meeting: Meeting minutes.
Consequences for Failing to Follow Procedures and Fulfill Expectations
Describe how, as a group, you would handle individuals who do not live up to this contract: Punish them. Will be decided at that time.
Describe what your team will do if these infractions continue: Worse punishments. (No physical or verbal abuse or cruelty)
Team Leadership
Every person on the team will have to take the role as a leader for at least two weeks. The role of the leader will be to organize meetings and make sure that everything is submitted in a timely manner. Here are some hints on what the leader should do. Please note here who will be responsible when:
